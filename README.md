## About collision-simulator

collision-simulator is quite literally a simulation of [collisions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision), with variable coefficients of restitution, built using [`pygame`](https://www.pygame.org/docs/) in Python.

*Date of creation:* `03 September, 2021`

It is an interactive simulation where the user spawns circles on the screen, that collide with each other and with walls. The collisions are handled using real [collision mechanics](https://www.lehman.edu/faculty/anchordoqui/chapter15.pdf).
